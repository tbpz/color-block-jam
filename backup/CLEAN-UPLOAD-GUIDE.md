# 🧹 Clean Upload Guide - Avoid 25MB Limit

## ✅ Problem Fixed!

I found and removed the problematic file:
- ❌ **Deleted:** `b6862f53c5db0dffd80a6274ce6c73bd.cache.dill.track.dill` (38.46 MB)
- ✅ **Safe:** All remaining files are under 25MB

## 🎯 Upload Strategy: Only Game Files

**DON'T upload the entire project!** Only upload what's needed for GitHub Pages.

### **ONLY Upload These Files from `build/web/`:**

Go to `D:\Tu\tic_tac_toe_game\build\web\` and upload:

**Essential Game Files:**
- ✅ `index.html`
- ✅ `main.dart.js` (1.8MB - your game!)
- ✅ `flutter_bootstrap.js`
- ✅ `flutter.js`
- ✅ `flutter_service_worker.js`
- ✅ `manifest.json`
- ✅ `favicon.png`
- ✅ `version.json`

**Essential Folders:**
- ✅ `assets/` (entire folder)
- ✅ `canvaskit/` (entire folder)
- ✅ `icons/` (entire folder)

### **DON'T Upload These:**
- ❌ `build/` folder (except build/web/ contents)
- ❌ `.dart_tool/` folder
- ❌ `android/` folder
- ❌ `ios/` folder
- ❌ `windows/` folder
- ❌ Any `.dill` files
- ❌ Large cache files

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Upload:

### **Option 1: Upload Just Game Files (Recommended)**
1. **Go to your new GitHub repository**
2. **Click "Add file" → "Upload files"**
3. **Go to `D:\Tu\tic_tac_toe_game\build\web\`**
4. **Select ALL files and folders in that directory**
5. **Drag them to GitHub**
6. **Commit**

### **Option 2: Upload Selective Project Files**
If you want the full Flutter project, upload these folders/files:
- ✅ `lib/` folder
- ✅ `pubspec.yaml`
- ✅ `pubspec.lock`
- ✅ `README.md`
- ✅ Everything from `build/web/` (see above)

## 🎯 Expected Repository Structure:

After upload, your GitHub repository should look like:
```
your-repository/
├── index.html              ← Your game entry point
├── main.dart.js            ← Your game code (1.8MB)
├── flutter_bootstrap.js    ← Flutter engine
├── assets/                 ← Game assets
├── canvaskit/              ← Flutter graphics
├── icons/                  ← App icons
├── manifest.json           ← App metadata
└── favicon.png             ← App icon
```

## ✅ After Upload:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages:** Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch: main
2. **Wait 2-3 minutes**
3. **Visit:** `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`
4. **Your Color Block Jam will work!** 🎮

**No more 25MB errors - your game will deploy perfectly!** 🎉
