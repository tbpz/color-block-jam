# 🚀 Deploy Color Block Jam to Vercel

## ✅ Fixed Flutter Build Issue!

The deployment is now configured to use **pre-built web files** instead of building on Vercel, avoiding the "flutter: command not found" error.

## Quick Deployment Steps:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
- Go to: https://github.com/new
- Name: `color-block-jam-game`
- Make it **PUBLIC**
- Initialize with README

### 2. Upload Project Files
Upload these files to your GitHub repository:

**Essential Files:**
- `lib/` (Flutter source code)
- `build/web/` (Pre-built web files) ⭐ **IMPORTANT!**
- `pubspec.yaml` (dependencies)
- `pubspec.lock` (version lock)
- `vercel.json` (deployment config - now uses pre-built files)
- `.gitignore` (updated to include build/web)
- `README.md`

**Platform Folders (optional):**
- `web/`, `android/`, `ios/`, etc.

### 3. Deploy with Vercel
- Go to: https://vercel.com/new
- Connect with GitHub
- Import your `color-block-jam-game` repository
- Vercel will serve the pre-built files directly!

### 4. Your Game URL
```
https://color-block-jam-game.vercel.app
```

## 🔧 What Changed:
- ❌ **Before:** Vercel tried to run `flutter build web` (failed)
- ✅ **Now:** Vercel serves pre-built files from `build/web/`
- ✅ **Result:** No Flutter installation required on Vercel!

## 🎮 Game Features:
- Drag & drop puzzle mechanics
- Colorful block matching
- 6x6 grid gameplay
- Mobile-friendly responsive design
- Win detection and move counter

**The Flutter build error is now completely resolved!** 🎉
