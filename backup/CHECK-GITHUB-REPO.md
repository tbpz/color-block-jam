# 🔍 Check Your GitHub Repository

## 🤔 Why You Don't See Folders

There are a few possible reasons:

### **Reason 1: Files Not Uploaded Yet**
You might have only uploaded some files to GitHub for Vercel, but not the actual game files.

### **Reason 2: Looking in Wrong Place**
You might be looking at the wrong repository or branch.

### **Reason 3: Build Folder Ignored**
The `.gitignore` file might be hiding the `build/` folder.

## 🔍 Let's Check Your Repository

### **Step 1: Go to Your GitHub Repository**
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Find your repository (should be named something like `color-block-jam-game`)
3. Click on it

### **Step 2: Check What's There**
Look for these files in your repository:

**Should See:**
- `README.md`
- `pubspec.yaml`
- `lib/` folder
- Maybe `vercel.json`

**Missing (This is the problem!):**
- ❌ `build/` folder
- ❌ `index.html`
- ❌ `main.dart.js`

## 🚀 Upload Your Game Files

Since the game files are missing, you need to upload them:

### **From Your Computer:**
1. **Open File Explorer**
2. **Go to:** `D:\Tu\tic_tac_toe_game\build\web\`
3. **You should see these files:**
   - `index.html`
   - `main.dart.js` (1.8MB)
   - `flutter_bootstrap.js`
   - `assets/` folder
   - `canvaskit/` folder
   - `icons/` folder

### **Upload to GitHub:**
1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click "Add file" → "Upload files"**
3. **Drag ALL files from `build/web/` folder**
4. **Commit the files**
