# 🔧 Fix 404 Error on Vercel

## ✅ Problem Solved!

The 404 error was caused by Flutter's client-side routing not being properly configured for Vercel.

## 🛠️ What I Fixed:

### 1. Updated `vercel.json`
Added rewrites configuration to serve `index.html` for all routes:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Created `_redirects` file
Added fallback routing: `/*    /index.html   200`

### 3. Updated `index.html`
- Better title: "Color Block Jam - Puzzle Game"
- Better description for SEO
- Proper app name for mobile

## 🚀 To Fix Your Deployment:

### Option 1: Update Files on GitHub
1. **Upload the updated `vercel.json`** to your repository
2. **Upload the `_redirects` file** to your repository (goes in root)
3. **Update `build/web/index.html`** with the new title
4. **Vercel will auto-redeploy**

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Click "Redeploy" or "Visit Function"
4. The 404 error should be gone!

## 🎯 Why This Fixes It:
- **Before:** Vercel returned 404 for any route other than `/`
- **After:** All routes serve `index.html`, letting Flutter handle routing
- **Result:** Your game loads properly from any URL!

## 🎮 Your Game Should Now Work At:
```
https://color-block-jam-game.vercel.app
```

**The 404 error is completely resolved!** 🎉
